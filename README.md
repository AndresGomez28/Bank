To ensure the success of the project, we have established the following requirements:

1. *Understanding of the Base Code*: Read and understand the provided NestJS application's basic structure, including TransferController, TransferService, and TransferModule.
2. *Definition of Types and DTOs*: Identification and definition of suitable types and DTOs to represent bank transfers, ensuring data integrity and security.
3. *Implementation of Type Safety*: Update the code to use the defined types and DTOs, ensuring proper handling of data.
4. *Improvement of Service Logic*: Complete the logic of each method in the TransferService class to perform CRUD operations on bank transfers efficiently and accurately.

## Deliverables and Evaluation
To assess the project's success, the following deliverables will be required:

- *Updated TransferService*: Complete logic for CRUD operations.
